        """
        Given a set of words (without duplicates), find all word squares you can build from them.

        A sequence of words forms a valid word square if the kth row and column read the exact same string,
        where 0 â‰¤ k < max(numRows, numColumns).

        For example, the word sequence ["ball","area","lead","lady"] forms a word square
        because each word reads the same both horizontally and vertically.

        b a l l
        a r e a
        l e a d
        l a d y

        Note:

        There are at least 1 and at most 1000 words.
        All words will have the exact same length.
        Word length is at least 1 and at most 5.
        Each word contains only lowercase English alphabet a-z.

        Example 1:

        Input:
        ["area","lead","wall","lady","ball"]

        Output:
        [
          [ "wall",
            "area",
            "lead",
            "lady"
          ],
          [ "ball",
            "area",
            "lead",
            "lady"
          ]
        ]

        Explanation:
        The output consists of two word squares. The order of output does not matter (just the order of words in each word square matters).

        Example 2:

        Input:
        ["abat","baba","atan","atal"]

        Output:
        [
          [ "baba",
            "abat",
            "baba",
            "atan"
          ],
          [ "baba",
            "abat",
            "baba",
            "atal"
          ]
        ]
