        Given an array of n positive integers and a positive integer s,
        find the minimal length of a contiguous subarray of which the sum â‰¥ s.
        If there isn't one, return 0 instead.

        Example:

        Input: s = 7, nums = [2,3,1,2,4,3]
        Output: 2
        Explanation: the subarray [4,3] has the minimal length under the problem constraint.
        Follow up:
        If you have figured out the O(n) solution, try coding another solution of which the time complexity is O(n log n).

        :type s: int
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: int

        give an array of positive numbers, we can use two pointers, because presume is strictly increasing.
