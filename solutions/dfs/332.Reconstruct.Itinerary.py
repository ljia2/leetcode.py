        In graph theory, an Eulerian trail (or Eulerian path) is a trail in a finite graph which visits every edge exactly once. (use all ticekts once)
        1) graph is connected
        2) staisfying either conditions
           a) only one node whose in-degree is less than out degree (as start); only one node whose in-degree is one more than out-degree (as end point); all other nodes whose in-degrees are equal to out-degrees
           b) all nodes whose in-degree is equal to its out-degree

        Then the graph must have a Eulerian trail.

        Similarly, an Eulerian circuit or Eulerian cycle is an Eulerian trail which starts and ends on the same vertex.
